# UCS Render Tools Installation

- In REAPER go to Extensions -> Reapack -> Import repositories...
- Copy/Paste [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeBaudio/MMB-Reaper-Scripts/master/index.xml) in the box and press OK
- Run the script MMB_UCS - Create Category Folders and choose the main parent folder that will contain all UCS category folder types. This will be the target folder theat the render script will point to by default
- When using the [USC Renmaing Tool](https://www.aaroncendan.me/side-projects/ucs) ensure that these boxes are ticked in the user settings window: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f410112-97e8-413a-a965-ee988bee682c)
- When running the UCS renaming tool this will add "Meta" markers to the assets you'll be rendering: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956d7a9e-5d75-437d-8448-8eba73208ea1)
- Select the items you wish to render then run the MMB_UCS - Embedded Marker Render script and the output directory will automatically point to the folder associated with the items category
- Selecting multiple items with different categories for export will display this error: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2f9d5c8-fb5f-4943-a178-c922af1e8170)
